Binary trees:

1. Full Binary tree- each node has either 0 or 2 children
2. Complete Binary tree- all levels are completely filled, except for last level which is as left skewed as possible
3. Perfect Binary tree- all leaf nodes at the same level
4. Balanced Binary tree- height can be a max of log(n)
5. Degenerate tree - a straight line/linked lsit of a tree


## Tree Traversal methods

1. Depth First Search:
    1). Inorder Traversal (Left + Root + Right)
    2). Pre-order Traversal (Root + Left + Right)
    3). Post-order Traversal (Left + Right + Root)
2. Breadth First Search:
    From top to bottom level search through the tree
